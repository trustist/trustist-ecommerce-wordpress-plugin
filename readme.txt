== Installation ==

In order to use the TrustistEcommerce plugin, you first need to have an active TrustistTransfer account. This can be created by signing up here - [https://trustist.org/TrustistTransferSignUpNow](https://trustist.org/TrustistTransferSignUpNow)

After signing up via that link, you’ll be taken through the full onboarding process which includes verifying your business. Once that is complete, you’re able to easily take transactions through TrustistTransfer, and you can proceed with the below steps to get your TrustistEcommerce plugin fully set up.

= Step 1 - Installing the Plugin =

Upload the TrustistEcommerce plugin to your WordPress site by either;

1. Searching for it in the ‘Plugins’ menu within your WordPress dashboard
2. Downloading the file from this page and using the ‘Upload Plugin’ button in the WordPress dashboard

Both methods can be seen in more detail here - [https://wordpress.com/support/plugins/install-a-plugin](https://wordpress.com/support/plugins/install-a-plugin/)

= Step 2 - Activating the Plugin =

In your WordPress dashboard, click ‘Plugins’ on the left and scroll down the page to find the entry for TrustistEcommerce. Under the plugin title, there will be an option to activate the plugin.

If the option below the title says ‘Deactivate’, the plugin is already active and ready to use.

= Step 3 - Configuration =

After activating the plugin, a new option will appear within the ‘Settings’ option in your WordPress dashboard for ‘TrustistEcommerce’. Clicking this will take you to the settings for your implementation, which is where you can insert your API keys.

To access  your API keys, please contact [customerservice@trustisttransfer.com](customerservice@trustisttransfer.com). 

Once you have the API keys, enter them into the corresponding fields and click ‘Save Changes & Test Connection’.

The ‘Connection Status’ under the API keys should change to be ‘Success’ if the details you have entered are correct. You will then also see more information about your account including:

* The name of the merchant you have connected
* The last date and time that the connection was checked
* Whether the additional features of card payments and standing orders are enabled in that merchant’s account

If, at any point, these details do not look correct or you are seeing consistently failing connections, please contact us at [customerservice@trustisttransfer.com](customerservice@trustisttransfer.com). 

= Step 4 - Create Your Payment Form =

You’re now able to set up a payment form on your website!
